Conveyor makes distributing desktop apps as easy as shipping a web app. It's a tool not a service, it generates and signs [self-upgrading packages for Windows, macOS and Linux using each platform's native package formats](outputs.md) without requiring you to have those operating systems, and it looks like this:

It's free for open source apps and has [simple per-project pricing](https://www.hydraulic.dev/pricing.html) for commercial apps.

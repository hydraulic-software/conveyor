// This is a config snippet that configures a Conveyor build to use the native library extraction feature (see user guide for details).
// It enables the feature and then configures popular libraries to look for their libraries in the JVM lib folder, instead of copying the
// libraries out of the JAR to the user's home directory.
//
// Although importing this config may result in system properties for libraries you don't use, the runtime cost is low and the usability
// benefit is high.
